## Project Description
The AirBnB is a Project to clone the famous AirBnB site which will inlude some steps for it full stack creation to touch all what we have covered in the ALX SE Programme \viz-a-viz:
- The console
- Web satic
- MySQL storage
- Web framework - templating
- RESTFUL API
- Web dynamic
## The console
  - to create the  data model
  - manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
  - store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. Tha is from our console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI which will be built, we won't necessary have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

The console abstraction is created to allow us change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

## MySQL storage
  - The temporary file Storage first used will be replaced by a Database storage
  - models are all mapped to a table in databasw by using an O.R.M.

## Web framework - templating
 - The stage where our web server will be created using Python
 -  And our static HTML file changed to dynamic by using objects stored in file or database 

## RESTful API
  - The point we will expose all objects stored via JSON web interface
  - objects manipulation via RESTful API

## Web dynamic
  - application of JQuery
  - load objects from client side using our built RESTFul API
